Designed for use with weed trimmers and brush cutters, the LimbSaver Comfort-Tech Weed Eater Sling reduces shoulder and body fatigue by distributing the weight over your entire upper body, not just your shoulder. Lightweight, weatherproof, and durable, the Weed Eater Sling incorporates LimbSaver's proprietary NAVCOM (Noise and Vibration Control Material) vibration dampening technology to reduce the negative effects of vibration. Quick and easy to install, the Weed Eater Sling is durably built to be used outdoors in harsh environments, and it has a no-slip surface that stays in place -- even in the rain.
